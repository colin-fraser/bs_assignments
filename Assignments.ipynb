    "- `ANNUAL_SALES`: the business's annual sales\n",

    "1. The marketing department would like to target a campaign to medium sized (100-999 Employees) customers who are in either Education or Food Services, and who currently spend less than $5000 total per year on all services. Create a boolean column called `INCLUDE` that indicates whether the customer on that row should be included in the campaign.\n",
    "2. How many customers are in the campaign?\n",
    "3. Pandas has a function called `crosstab` which prints cross tabulations of categorical variables. Use the `crosstab` function to determine how many customers in each industry and province are included in the campaign.\n",
    "4. Create a file called `customerids.csv` that contains _only_ a list of `CUSTOMER_ID`s to be included in the campaign."
